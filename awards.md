**Nominations for the 2023 Zephies are open!  Nominations are due on August 26, 2022**

To clarify some past confusion regarding the different Zephyr Awards, the Zephyr Award Committee has restructured and redefined
the Award definitions and descriptions.

There will be two categories of awards, Person and Project. Within each category, there are two options depending on level of impact.
