title: "Diversity Resources"
---

It is critical that the people responsible for conducting analysis that determines trillions of dollars of future infrastructure investments and policies are reflective of the diversity of backgrounds that will be affected by those decisions. 

As our decisions are increasingly able to be informed by data and analysis, it is critical to develop a workforce that is able to both identify appropriate analysis techniques as well as communicate insights. It is well known that data and models reflect the biases of those who collect and create it, and bringing in and empowering underrepresented voices will improve important decisions based on data and models.

As we develop a more proactive diversity program (i.e. [Emerging Leaders Fellowship](https://medium.com/zephyrfoundation/zephyr-fellowship-for-emerging-travel-analysis-leaders-6c1261405c4f)) we have been coming across a multitude of resources that are applicable to our field.
