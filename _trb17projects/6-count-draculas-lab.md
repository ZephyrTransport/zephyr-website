title: Count Dracula's Lab – Standardizing Observed Travel Data
short-description: Travel analysis will increasingly be relying on massive amounts of data collected using imperfect and inconsistent methods. Yet data wrangling can easily eat up a lot of bandwidth or budget.  This team explored if it would be helpful for Zephyr to incubate an open-source data wrangling interface.
description:  Travel analysis will increasingly be relying on massive amounts of data collected using imperfect and inconsistent methods. Agencies and consultants that have the bandwidth for utilizing these data sources undertake a significant amount of start-up time in wrangling the data, while others rely on either data providers, who typically do not divulge their methods, or consultants, who often are doing the same thing over and over again, reducing efficiency. Some agencies like SFCTA have developed nascent open source tools to store and wrangle data and interface with travel models, such as “CountDracula.” However, public agencies are not good owners of open source products. This project would (A) create standardized data schema for observed travel data; (B) build upon the CountDracula data management tool; (C) extend CountDracula to add a “Count Dracula’s Lab” which would add data fusion and cleaning features; and (D) extend CountDracula’s visualization features to be more public facing.

## What are different users and their needs?

Variety of data types:

- Origin-destination: person flows  
- Point: flows, crash  
- Network: flows, projects  
- Area: event, weather, land use  

Data schema should have capability to tag.

## What can Zephyr do?
### Survey Agencies to identify state of the practice

Identify state of the practice for data warehousing on both the planning and IT side.

- What they collect
- Current process
- Storage
- How they use
- What could be done better
- Freshness policies
- Concerns of privacy
- [IT] Privacy
- [IT] Data storage
- [IT] Which database/softwares

### Identify and organize interested agencies and implementation partners

Implementation partners
-	Big data providers 
-	Smartphone apps
-	Enthusiastic agencies
-   Academics
-	Concrete working groups? w/ academics, industry, agencies

Agencies could contribute working hours/staff instead of funding  
Data providers could contribute data instead of funding  
Could brainstorm produce proof of concepts for various features using a hackathon  


## What does the potential product evolution look like? MVP, v1, v2, etc

-

## What are the data standards that we would need?

- 

## What is the relative level of priority for this effort?
