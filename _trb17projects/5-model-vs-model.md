title: Model vs Model
short-description: This team explored what it would take to rigorously assess model performance in a testbed environment and determine what resources would be needed to make it successful.
description:  Zephyr could consider providing research grants to academics and other researchers to calibrate their model systems for a single metropolitan area. Then, assess the models’ performance across time, ideally a period of ten years, to see how well they perform. This project would explore what it would take to do this in a rigorous and useful way; how to select the test bed and identify the set of stakeholders; and determine what resources would be needed to make it successful.
latest-update: As discussed at the 2017 TRB Annual Meeting

## What goals/specific outcomes should this initiative have?

Goals: 

- Help regions identify the models and tools that best serve their needs  
- Save regions the trouble of producing the same thing over and over [ particularly if it isn't useful ] 

There is likely value in evaluating Sketch planning tools vs complex models
Mixed thoughts on whether to include land use models.

## What steps are involved in moving this initiative forward
### Identify Test Beds

Thoughts: 
- should there be multiple test beds with different features/sizes?
- it is a real challenge to find a singular "representative" location
- Suggested comparisons of 2010 and 2020

Potential criteria for determining where test bed should be: 
 - what 'evaluatable' changes happened over the 10 year period vs what sensitivities do we want to test? 
 - willingness and motivation to participate
 - political resilience
 
### Define Performance Evaluation Process**

Discussed requirements for doing a comparison:
  
  - calibrated to same data
  - should achieve similar validation

Definition of a “better” model system depends on the questions being asked and will likely be very different for small cities compared to complex regions.

Metric types include:  

- screenlines
- VMT
- other regional performance measures
- project-level


## What budget/funding would be needed?

- 

## What priority/urgency should model vs model have compared to others for Zephyr?
There were a diversity of opinions, but in general the group thought this was a mid-level priority.  There are other topics that would need to feed into this one.
