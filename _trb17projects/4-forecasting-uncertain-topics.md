title: Exploring Uncertain Topics
short-description:  How do we consider impending transformational changes within the span of our forecasts that are clearly outside the bounds of elasticities we can currently observe? This project considers “uncertain topics” such as the introduction of automated and connected vehicles and discusses how Zephyr could help. 
description:  Current travel demand models are observed conditions models. For the first time in decades, the industry is faced with transformational changes within the span of our forecasts that renders those conditions obsolete. This proposal is to create a parallel version of a model which considers “uncertain topics” such as the introduction of automated and connected vehicles. The model would exist as a set of alternate procedures that could be toggled on and off, and would inform certain changes to the structure of the observed conditions model necessary to invoke these changes. What would such a model need to consider? Changes to highway operations such as capacities, speeds, volume/delay functions, signal operations; changes to how travel costs are experienced or perceived; Changes in how passenger vehicles are allocated and used; and more. How could Zephyr help spearhead this work?

## What are different stakeholders and their needs and motivations?
**Decision-makers** need both answers they can use and full understanding of spectrum of likelihoods.  How can policymakers organize themselves to maximize their impact in affecting technology development that is favorable for society?  In many cases policymakers are already skeptical of the results of these models, so we should seek to minimize their uncertainty.

Most **forecasters** make educated guesses about uncertain futures and present ranges such as conservative, moderate, and liberal. But spectrums are hard to understand, hard to create, and in many cases not allowed by existing political and legal processes.

## What can Zephyr do to help? What goals/specific outcomes should this initiative have?
(i.e. Offer guidance? Document/categorize solutions? Undertake specific work or research? )

### Examine different ways of using existing models
Document a different way of using existing models to forecast uncertain topics, emphasizing scenario planning while retaining the trust of decision-makers.

Present model results to decision-makers in a way that they can test different scenarios and alternative futures. 

Make degrees of freedom easier to tweak in order to more easily do scenario analysis / reduce embedded assumptions.

### Synthesize, Critique and Disseminate Existing Research and Practices
There are considerable amount of people attempting to model CAV behavior and lots of research on CAV behavior being conducted as well.  A synthesis and critique of research and forecasting approaches would be helpful.

### Provide recommendations for updating existing models 
Identify parts of existing models [ demand and network ]  that are likely to require sensitivities and recommend elasticities to test.  

Value of time and auto availability models are obvious examples. With auto availability models. 

### Develop new forecasting paradigm
Engage decision-makers and modelers in developing new forecasting paradigm involving 'futures' rather than 'forecasts'.  Zephyr could bridge the discussion so that the two groups can identify weaknesses in models, and then brainstorm ways to make the models more extensive.

Zephyr should engage in advocacy for allowing models to appropriately tepresent uncertainty

### Explore new model types
Models are traditionally based on observed behavior. Do we need a change in the entire paradigm of modeling to forecast these uncertain topics?  

Thoughts:  

 - Maybe Bayesian techniques?
