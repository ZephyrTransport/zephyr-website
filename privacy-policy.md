The Zephyr Foundation (Foundation) places a high priority on protecting your privacy.

### Email Privacy
The Foundation does not provide, sell, or rent email addresses to anyone outside the organization.

### Sensitive Information
The Foundation does not retain any sensitive information (payment methods, social security numbers, voting records) in its own files.  The Foundation relies on outside service providers to process payment information and voting and refers you to their respective privacy policies.

The Foundation uses Stripe for online payment processing. Please refer to Stripe's website ([http://stripe.com](http://stripe.com)) for their policies.

### How Your Information May Be Used
We use your personal information to provide you with personalized service; to send e-mail alerts to you; to answer your requests; to process your membership application; etc. You may choose to opt out at any time, which will cease all communications from us.

We may also use your information to track visitors of our website. This lets us see which of our features are the most popular so we can better serve our users' needs. It also lets us provide aggregate data about our traffic (not identifying you personally, but showing how many visitors used which features, for example) to outside parties.  Please refer to our [Website Terms of Use](/terms-of-use) for more details.

### Modifications
The Foundation reserves the right to modify this Policy at any time and will place the most up to date version on its website.
