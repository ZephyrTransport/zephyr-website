Zephyr is governed by a Board of Directors supported by the Founding Stakeholders and a team of Instigators.  

### <i class="fa fa-institution" style="color:#{{ site.highlight-color }}" aria-hidden="true"></i> Board of Directors
This initial Board was elected by the Zephyr Founding Stakeholders in order to reflect a diversity of interests, industries, and backgrounds. In May of each year, roughly a quarter of the Board will be elected by the [Zephyr Membership](/members).
