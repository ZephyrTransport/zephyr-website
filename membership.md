Members are at the heart of the Zephyr Foundation’s organizational structure.  Members are responsible for electing the Board of Directors and play a key role in supporting the organizational core through volunteership as well as their membership dues.

This structure was selected based on extensive consultation within our community as well as research on similar organizations in other fields and has the following advantages:
- Allows the foundation to undertake shared “backbone” support roles for the industry rather than relying on project- or program-specific grants which tend to ebb and flow.
- Priorities are responsive to both grassroots (member) needs as well as strategic (top-down) priorities.
- Shared ownership of the Foundation by the community creates buy-in.

### Membership Process

Any individual shall be eligible for membership if they have paid their dues and agree to abide by terms of membership. Any member reported to the Executive Committee for violating the Terms of Membership shall have their membership suspended and potentially revoked upon confirmation of a violation.
- *Report violations of terms of membership to [membership@zephyrtransport.org](mailto:membership@zephyrtransport.org)*

### Types of memberships

- **Individuals** can choose "Standard" or "Student/Youth" membership. Student/Youth memberships are limited to students in a degree-seeking program, or anyone under the age of thirty at the time of application.

- **Agencies** should consider a [Zephyr Subscription](/subscriptions) instead of individual memberships.

- Please contact us for business, corporate, and institution memberships.

### How to become a member

- We'll need your name, email, and a valid credit/debit card info to process your membership
