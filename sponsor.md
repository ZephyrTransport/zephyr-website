### Donate directly

Zephyr accepts donations by check or by credit card.

**By Check.** Checks can be made out to:
Zephyr Foundation.

Please [email](mailto:info@zephyrtransport.org) to find out where to send them!

**By Credit Card**

Donate right now using a credit card. Just select a donation level below. We use the [Stripe](https://stripe.com) payment system, which means we never see your credit card number and thus cannot lose it.
