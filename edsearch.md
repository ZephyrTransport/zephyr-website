*June 11, 2019*

It's been a great year at Zephyr, and we now have funding secured to hire our first paid position - our Executive Director! We are seeking a motivated, ambitious Executive Director to oversee and advance the Zephyr mission: to advance rigorous transportation and land use decision-making for the public good, by advocating for and supporting improved travel analysis and facilitating its implementation.

This is a hands-on position: we want someone who can jump in and handle operational responsibility for the Zephyr programs and volunteers, following the strategic direction set by the Board of Directors. As a new organization, Zephyr needs someone who is excited about our mission, who can manage the varied tasks of running a nonprofit foundation, as well as an executive who can prioritize fundraising: since without funding it will be impossible to realize any of the foundation’s goals.

I hope you are as excited about tackling this challenge as we are about funding and providing this position! _We do not expect any one person to have a long pedigree in each of these areas: rather, it's a position that has many facets which a candidate can grow into._

Here's a reminder of what Zephyr's all about, and specifically what the Executive Director position entails.

#### Zephyr Principles:

- Respectful, honest, technical-based interaction;
- Collegial and collaborative;
- Driven by useful innovation that leverages our unique position;
- Acting in support of the public good, specifically inclusion, equitable outcomes, and shared prosperity;
- User-friendly packaging and licensing;
- Consistently high-quality work products;
- Faithful implementation of standards;
- Respectful of time and resources;
- Diversity of opinions and backgrounds are proactively sought out and welcomed; and,
- Lawfulness as mandatory.

# Responsibilities

### Operations

- Primary staff liaison to Board of Directors, ensuring operational efficacy in organizational policies and practice.
- Work closely with project management groups, volunteers, members, and related organizations.
- Engage with the Board on strategic planning, regarding organizational structure, financial health, governance, priorities, and vision.
- Serve as liaison with legal counsel and accountant. Manage all contracts.
- Works with board and staff to ensure that all programs are consistent with Zephyr’s strategic vision.
- Oversee communication efforts.

### Financial

- Manage monthly and annual budget, ensure that the organization operates within the approved budget and is sustainable.
- Fundraise and develop other resources necessary to support the mission, including fostering relationships with other foundations, drafting and submitting grant applications, and developing contacts with high impact donors.
- Responsible for Zephyr’s fiscal integrity, working hand-in-hand with the Board-appointed Treasurer and board members.

### General

- Communicate effectively with the Board; ensuring they have all information necessary to make informed decisions
- Work with the Board to develop a strategic plan for the organization and execute the plan.
- Regularly measure and evaluate Zephyr’s progress towards its goals; redirect efforts and propose changes as warranted by evaluation.

- Represent Zephyr nationally with media, partners, decision-makers, and members.

# Qualifications

The ideal candidate will have experience with government decision-making in transportation and land-use, travel analysis methods, and non-profit structures. A background that includes transportation or planning is essential, but we do not expect any incoming member of the team to have expertise in all areas.

A willingness and enthusiasm for collaborating with experts and young professionals is critical to success in this role. Applicants should have a passion for (and, preferably, a background in) centering diversity and inclusion in the organization.

### Additional Qualifications:

- High integrity leadership.
- Bachelor’s Degree.
- A willingness to roll up your sleeves and join in on any tasks necessary -- that means that some days will find you running high-level meetings with CEOs in the morning and manually updating a mailing list in the afternoon.
- Strong organizational skills including program development.
- Management experience.  Experience managing remote teams preferred.
- Budget management experience.
- Experience in fundraising -- grant writing a plus.
- Ability to both lead and work as a member of the team.
