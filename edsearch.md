The Zephyr Foundation (“Zephyr”) is seeking a motivated and ambitious Executive Director to oversee and advance its mission: to advance rigorous transportation and land use decision-making for the public good, by advocating for and supporting improved travel analysis and facilitating its implementation.

The Executive Director will have the overall operational responsibility for the Zephyr staff, volunteers and programs according to the strategic direction set with the Board of Directors. As a new organization, Zephyr needs an executive who can prioritize fundraising, since without funding it will be impossible to realize any of the foundation’s goals. In addition, the Executive Director will be responsible for building organizational culture and an operational environment that aligns with the following

#### Zephyr Principles:

- Acting in support of the public good, specifically inclusion, equitable outcomes, and shared prosperity;
- User-friendly packaging and licensing;
- Consistently high-quality work products;
- Faithful implementation of standards;
- Respectful of time and resources;
- Diversity of opinions and backgrounds are proactively sought out and welcomed; and,
- Lawfulness as mandatory.

# Responsibilities

- Responsible for Zephyr’s fiscal integrity.
- Fundraise and develop other resources necessary to support the mission, including fostering relationships with other foundations, drafting and submitting grant applications, and developing contacts with high impact donors.
- Manage monthly and annual budget, ensure that the organization operates within the approved budget and is sustainable.

### Operations

- Represent Zephyr nationally with media, partners, decision-makers, and members.

# Qualifications

The ideal candidate will have experience with government decision-making in transportation and land-use, travel analysis methods, and non-profit structures. A background that includes transportation or planning is essential, but we do not expect any incoming member of the team to have expertise in all areas. A willingness and enthusiasm for collaborating with experts and young professionals is critical to success in this role. Applicants should have a passion for (and, preferably, a background in) centering diversity and inclusion in the organization.

### Additional Qualifications:

- High integrity leadership.
- Experience in fundraising -- grant writing a plus.
- Bachelor’s Degree.

- Ability to oversee and collaborate with a diverse group of volunteers, staff, and partners.
- Technological savvy and grit.
- Demonstrated written and oral communication skills.
