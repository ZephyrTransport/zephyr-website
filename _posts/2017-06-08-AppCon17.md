short-description: Summary of Zephyr Activities and Feedback at the 2017 TRB Planning Applications Conference
---

It feels like yesterday when we were throwing out the idea of a foundation for travel analysis at the 2016 Innovations in Travel Modeling Conference in Denver.  Since then progress has been slow, but sure, in order to gain the most buy-in and shape the organization's mission and purpose based on relevant needs.  Now we are ready for the rubber to meet the road, which means we can stop talking and deciding on mission, and start doing. 

In addition to reporting on progress (including electing an initial board!), this year's workshop at the 2017 TRB Planning Applications Conference focused on getting a feel for what the community wanted Zephyr to look like in terms of membership, dues, sponsors, benefits, priority tasks, and size, and also pitted three potential projects against each other in a "Shark Tank" style competition.

Congratulations to Lisa Zorn for pitching the winning Shark Tank project, [General Travel Network Standard and Tools](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D2j67Q7006XssLuRhAx5_cupeF51W9VQVvpWjtvf8y8) and to Joe Castiglione and Kermit Wies who put forward important topics for Zephyr to consider.
