short-description: Zephyr Code Directory is a resource for finding and learning about open source tools for travel analysis. 
---

Along the way of finding some funding to piece together the Zephyr Foundation, we picked up a project to create a [directory of useful open source tools](https://zephyrtransport.github.io/zephyr-directory/) for the Travel Analysis industry.  

The directory aims to be a resource cataloging tools that are either broadly useful or serve as a well-documented example from which to learn.  We will also maintain documentation and open-source license requirements in orer to be listed.  

Please get in touch with us if you have any code that you think meets the [ requirements ](https://zephyrtransport.github.io/zephyr-directory/articles/adding-a-project/)  that you'd like to see listed on the site [ or send us  a pull request! ].  Over time we hope that this will fill out with useful articles and project examples along the lines of what was discussed at the  <a href="{{ site.url }}/trb17projects/3-Community-owned-travel-modeling-software/">2017 TRB Annual Meeting workshop subgroup on Community-Owned travel modeling software</a>.
