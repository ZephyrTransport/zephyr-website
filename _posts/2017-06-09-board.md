### Selection Process
This combination of talented individuals reflects a diversity of interests, industries, and backgrounds, which Zephyr needs in order to be effective and relevant.  We really appreciated the Founding Stakeholders’ guidance and assistance in finding and attracting these individuals to these non trivial volunteer duties. The founding stakeholders, as the initial Zephyr membership voted up/down on the entirety of the board slate.

Note that in future election processes, roughly a quarter of the board will be elected in any single year so that we can retain institutional knowledge.
