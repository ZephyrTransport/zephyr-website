## Goals for Workforce Development

### Recruit
Increase awareness and create a  career pathway for students interested in related university fields.

 * Create and maintain a “front door” to the community + a brand for the field  
 * Host guest lecture database  
 * Host useful recruitment tools and strategies  

### Educate
Create, disseminate, maintain, and update a list of field “fundamentals.

 * Research current education gaps  
 * Identify common tools and standards  
 * Create library of teaching tools and for professors who aren’t primarily travel analysts.  
 * Hold tutorials and classes

### Collaborate
Create and promote cross-sector, cross-institution collaborations.

 * Create fellowships modeled on Data Science for Social Good and Code for America
 * Package research developments for practitioner consumption
 * Package “calls for assistance” to other research communities

### Keep
Incentivize people to come and _stay_ in the field.

 * Curate a fun and welcoming community.  Start a mentoring program.
 * Reward and recognize outstanding contributions.  Develop an awards program.
 * Conduct a State of the Workforce Survey every two years to track defection, job satisfaction, skill needs, and competitor fields.
