Badges distributed by Zephyr that software projects display in their GitHub repositories are a simple and low-stakes way for Zephyr to signal our support for software development projects. 

**Meeting Announcement**

The Software Badging Project Management Group will meet at the TRB Annual Meeting in Washington DC.

  - Tues Jan 15th 10:30-12:00
  - Eastern Market (M3) / Marriott Marquis in Washington DC.  

*Note that seating may be limited and will be prioritized for PMG members*


## Governance

This project is overseen by a board-approved Project Management Group (PMG) as follows:
 - David Ory, WSP Inc. (Chair)
 - Kat Busch, Sidewalk Labs
 - Billy Charlton, TU Berlin (Board Representative)
 - Dan Florian, INRO
 - Jeffrey Newman, Cambridge Systematics
 - Ben Stabler, RSG
 - Kyle Ward, Caliper 
 - Lisa Zorn, Metropolitan Transportation Commission 
 
## Approach

The badge program should have the following features:

 - An open application process in which software projects are reviewed for features such as openness, community involvement, continuous integration and/or other good coding practices, relationship to improving travel analysis, etc;  
 - Annual project audits to assess progress and adherence to standards;   
 - API-based badge that can be rendered in a GitHub markdown page; and,  
 - Potentially used as a consideration in awarding Zephyr grants.  

**Workplan**  

1. Establish PMG [complete]  
2. Establish metrics [beta complete]  
3. Develop and test an application [beta complete]  
4. Develop and test an API for the badge  
5. Establish annual auditing program
