## About

The software badging effort was [established](https://medium.com/zephyrfoundation/software-badgers-8388db3ca278) in 2018 to highlight the excellent open-source software development activities in our community. We articulated our [motivations and criteria](https://medium.com/zephyrfoundation/developing-badge-worthy-standards-52a80d89ff45) and badged our first project in late 2019.
