description: Develop a set of badges to award software tools that meet various criteria.  
front: True
---

Badges distributed by Zephyr that software projects display in their GitHub repositories are a simple and low-stakes way for Zephyr to signal our support for software development projects. 

## Updates

The Software Badging Project Management Group (aka, the "Badgers"), initially divided ourselves into the following four teams: 

 - **Tech**: this team focused on building out the technology to support the deployment of badges;
 - **Image**: this team focused on building versions of what the badge would look like;
 - **Criteria**: this team focused on what criteria we should use to award badges; and,
 - **Process**: this team focused on what the process should be to award badges.

The "criteria" issue was, as expected, the most difficult -- but also the most collaborative, interesting, and awarding. 
 
## Approach

The badge program should have the following features:

 - An open application process in which software projects are reviewed for features such as openness, community involvement, continuous integration and/or other good coding practices, relationship to improving travel analysis, etc;  
 - Annual project audits to assess progress and adherence to standards;   
 - API-based badge that can be rendered in a GitHub markdown page; and,  
 - Potentially used as a consideration in awarding Zephyr grants.  

**Workplan**  

1. Establish PMG [complete]  
2. Beta-version of the minimally-viable badging technology, [demonstrated here](https://github.com/dkyleward/synpop80);
3. Internal draft of criteria document (complete);
4. Initial customer feedback interviews (complete);
5. Public draft criteria document (goal: April 1, 2019);
6. Public draft process form or forms (goal: May 1, 2019);
7. Public draft badge image (goal: April 1, 2019);
8. Beta badging process in place for submittals (goal: April 15, 2019).
