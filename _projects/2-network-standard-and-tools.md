## Project Background

Winner of the project "shark tank" as [presented here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D2j67Q7006XssLuRhAx5_cupeF51W9VQVvpWjtvf8y8/) by Lisa Zorn of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission at the 2017 TRB Planning Applications Conference.

**The Problem**
Coding networks is a waste of time and prone to errors.
This wastes:

* Agency staff time + consulting resources  

This limits:

* Number of scenarios that can be run  
* Leveraging existing work  
* Access to most up to date or consistent information  

**The Solution**
General Travel Network Format Specification, Standards, + Tools.

* Specification of network and transit data similar to what GTFS has done for transit
* Defined Quality Standards for completeness  
* Tools to validate, edit, version control and manage networks (+  the projects that comprise them)

**Why Zephyr?**

Solving this problem requires buy in from a large stakeholder community spanning agencies and various industries.
Will want to pool resources

Existing attempts suffer from:

 * “Not invented here” syndrome
 * Lack of mandate to follow-through


**Key Challenges**

1. Getting the right people to participate and buy-in

- Negotiating differences should include substantial due process  
- Need to make decisions while not leaving other camps behind  

2. Implementation

- Make it easy: Developers / software vendors will need to lead in their support  
- Provide benefit early: Will need to incentivize use with alluring tools and perhaps fame  

**Deliverables**

 * Requirements Documentation based on market research
 * Open Data Standard + Schema for Travel Networks (GTNS)
   * Could build upon or be a collection of existing standards
   * Documented on GitHub
   * Policies and procedures for updating and maintaining
 * Quality Standard
   * Define at least three tiers of completeness
 * Tools
   * To validate the validity and quality of data
   * Outline of additional needed tools based on market research

**Benefits include:**

 * Open data sharing  
 * Shared tool and visualization development  
 * Quality control  
 * Scenario management
