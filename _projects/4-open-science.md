description: Develop a set of badges for projects that meet criteria for openness and reproducibility.
front: True  
---

Badges distributed by Zephyr to recognize open and reproducible research will incentivize authors to archive and share data, code, and models associated with their research articles. This standard enables other authors to more easily build upon that research.  

## Governance

This project is overseen by a board-approved Project Management Group (PMG) as follows:
 - Andre Carrel, The Ohio State University (chair)
 - Jason Hawkins, University of Nebraska Lincoln  
 - Jawad Mahmud Hoque, WSP  
 - Xuesong Zhou, Arizona State University  
 
 *More to come! Please let Andrew Carrel([carrel.20@osu.edu](mailto:carrel.20@osu.edu)) know if you are interested in contributing* 
 
## Approach

**Workplan**:

***1. Agree upon review/certification process***
The PMG is considering the following questions:
  - What are our standards?  Some examples might be:
	  - If model estimation results are presented, the model estimation files should be archived.  
	  - The model estimation scripts or code should also be provided for the final models presented.  
	  - If the paper includes figures, the data and associated geographic files underlying those figures should be archived. 
	  - If the paper presents the results of travel model runs, the model runs themselves should be archived.  
	  - Metadata should be provided describing files and field names.  
	  - A knowledgeable reviewer should be able to run the models/scripts/estimations to recreate the tables and results presented in the paper.  
  - Is there a single badge, or is there value in considering different tiers (silver and gold)?  
  - How do we deal with proprietary data?
  - How do we deal with confidential data obtained from consumer surveys, etc.?
2. Get buy-in and implementation support from academics, journals, Zephyr.
  - What is the process for awarding badges?  An additional stand-alone review?  Integrated with the normal peer review process?   
  - What strategies can we employ to make a badge a positive incentive?
