title: Collaborative Open-Source Software Development and Maintenance
description: Provide continued administrative, management, and promotion support to software projects of broad interest to the Zephyr community in order to reduce redundant projects, improve overall quality, continuity, and broaden adoption and use.
---

Multiple agencies, researchers and developers often have similar goals and wish to collaboratively develop software to reduce redundancy and leverage cross-agency expertise. Once developed, these tools need constant nurturing, promotion, and maintenance in order for the initial investment to remain useful and relevant into the future.  Currently there are several contractual and administrative barriers to collaborative development.

Simply organizing the contractual and governance structure for such a project can be quite burdensome.  For example, if three MPOs each want to develop a similar model, they may need to create an inter-agency agreement and jump through a number of hoops.  There is also the question of where the resulting product “lives” and who maintains it, if each is only charged with responsibility for their own jurisdiction.  

Rather than relying on individual agencies with fickle funding and time to maintain and manage software, a neutral and non-commercial entity such as Zephyr will be able to more effectively and efficiently manage the continued improvement and management of the project.
