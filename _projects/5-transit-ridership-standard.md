Data standards have been pivotal in creating a shared ecosystem of client-, public-, regulator- and manager-centric data discovery. Starting with Tri-Met and GTFS and more recently GBFS, data standards have made it commonplace to know how and when to use transit or other mobility services.  GTFS-ride complements LA and Santa Monica’s MDS efforts (which is currently restricted to dockless mobility) to provide a picture of where people are using the system, which can provide insight into deficiencies or opportunities to improve the experience of the travelling public. 

## Governance

This project is overseen by a board-approved Project Management Group (PMG) as follows:

- David Porter, OSU (Chair)  
- Matthew Barnes, ODOT   
- Aaron Antrim, Trillium  
- Clint Daniels, RSG (Board Representative)  
- Alex Bettinardi, ODOT  
- Phillip Carleton, OSU  

There is also a GTFS-ride consortium group that acts in advisory capacity.  All notes, transcripts and presentations [are available online](https://www.gtfs-ride.org/consortium/meetings.html).

## Progress

Led by the Oregon Department of Transportation and Oregon State University, a substantial amount of progress has been made both on the standard side as well as the documentation, outreach and coalition-building.

## Approach

The GTFS-ride project stewards identified the following needs for the project:

 - General awareness building,   
 - Building a software ecosystem,  
 - Transit agency adoption,  
 - Software vendor adoption, and   
 - A process surrounding data standard evolution.

Administratively, the project needs:

 - A jurisdiction-agnostic, persistent (not project- or funding-based) home, and
 - Funding for ongoing care and maintenance.  


**Workplan**
*draft, not PMG approved*  

 - Establish 3-5 partner transit agencies to help co-develop  
 - Develop a “killer app” or something just as useful, like a shared ETL workflow based on shared agency needs  
 - Pepper the tech and policy conference (i.e. AAPTA, NACTO, Railvolution, PyData, Bloomberg) and communications (CityLab, etc) circuits
 - Establish a shared funding pool from with to fund fellows or other people to evolve, build, and share.   
 - Create a roadmap for the standard itself, including its relationship with other standards (i.e. MDS)
