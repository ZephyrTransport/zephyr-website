Scientific journals have long been central to ensuring the community-level advancement of science by recording the data from experiments, sharing the methods of those experiments so they can be reproduced elsewhere, and providing a mechanism for external reviews. However, as our data sets become larger, and our models more complex, the limits of the scientific paper as the basic unit of trade are increasingly clear.  Data are often not properly archived, code may be difficult for someone other than the original author to penetrate, and it is often a description of the model, not the model itself that gets reviewed.  While we do not challenge the core role that journals should continue to play, we also recognize that a complementary mechanism is needed to further promote these community scientific goals.

This effort will provide a supplemental peer-review process for transportation analysis research, focused on whether a submitted project meets basic standards of documentation and reproducibility. Certification can be a requirement of research funding and certified projects will be featured on the Zephyr Foundationâ€™s website.
