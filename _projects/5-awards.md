This effort would establish a set of annual awards for people, models, projects or research that promote the mission, vision and goals of the Zephyr Foundation.  

One of these awards will be the _Travel Modeling as Science Award_ which will focus on:
 1. Has the project undergone rigorous, scientific testing?  For
    example, has it been tested for multiple years (and ideally multiple
    locations) and compared against actual changes?  
 2. Is the project open and available to other researchers to build upon? 
 3.	Does it address an important problem in transportation and provide a useful analysis tool to doing so?

Awards such as this may be an easy way to incentivize certain types of research and standards in research.  The cost is low to administer an award, but the value to a young researcher can be high.
