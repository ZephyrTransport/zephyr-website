**The 2023 Exceptional Technical Achievement Award was presented on January 10, 2023**

## Award Description

The **Exceptional Technical Achievement Award** shall be given in recognition of a project that has a potential for a positive impact on the transportation and/or land use decision-making field that meets the majority of the following criteria.
* Has been implemented, adopted or applied in practice at least once
* Whose methodology, formula, design, etc. are freely accessible to the public
* Promotes multilateral collaboration; and
* Advances the travel analysis field for the public good.

Nominees are considered by a three-person award committee and forwarded to the Zephyr Board for approval.  Awards are made at the TRB Annual Meeting.

## 2023 Awardee

**Congratulations to the winner of the 2023 Exceptional Technical Achievement Award: Travel Model Improvement Program Exploratory Modeling and Analysis Tool (TMIP-EMAT)**

If the pandemic has a silver lining, it’s that most people now understand what “uncertainty” really means in forecasting. The exploratory modeling ethos underpinning TMIP-EMAT is increasingly recognized as an important part of transportation planning. TMIP-EMAT was developed to help agencies manage uncertainties by illuminating interactions between transportation supply and demand on the urban surface transportation system through exploratory modeling and simulation; provide insights of potential, possible, plausible, probable, or preferred futures; and support robust regional transportation planning decision-making incorporating principles of risk management. The methods introduced and applied using TMIP-EMAT extend and enhance the analytical capabilities of travel models, and numerous agencies have adopted these tools in whole or in part. Most notably, Vancouver’s TransLink has integrated exploratory modeling at a fundamental level into their planning process using this tool. Other users of TMIP-EMAT for transportation planning and modeling efforts include, but are not limited to, ORDOT, TxDOT, RTC, RTD.

The committee selected this project because we think it addresses the often-ignored problem around uncertainty and sensitivity in travel demand modeling. The project is well documented online via [Github](https://github.com/tmip-emat/tmip-emat) and [Read the Docs](http://tmip-emat.github.io/), and it has webinars and summary reports available on FHWA and TMIP websites.
