*Congratulations to the winner of the 2020 Exceptional Technical Achievement Award: The Sacramento Area Council of Government's Technical Team for advancing a transparent and collaborative transportation modeling enterprise capable of addressing emerging transportation technologies as well as California statewide mandates*

The Sacramento Area Council of Government (SACOG) Technical Team effort represented a collaborative and transparent approach to model development and advancement.  Given the tough California Statewide mandates and the emerging mobility options and transportation technologies that are particularly active in California, the SACOG team had a very challenging task in developing their Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) update.  The SACOG team devoted considerable effort in improving modeling procedures and testing new features, with a view to better reflect the potential impacts of transformative technologies in transportation.  The SACOG team adopted a collaborative and transparent approach to model development, thus enhancing trust in the modeling process and providing policy makers an appropriate understanding of how results should be interpreted and used in planning future transportation policies and investments. The effort is to be commended for its contributions to advancing best practice.

The 2020 Exceptional Technical Achievement Award Committee was:  

 - Ram Pendyala, Arizona State University (chair)
 - Hani Mahmassani, Northwestern University  
 - Stephen Lawe, RSG Inc.
