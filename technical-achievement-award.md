**Congratulations to the winner of the 2021 Exceptional Technical Achievement Award: The VisionEval Team for developing a set of strategic planning tools to help planners evaluate policy alternatives.**

[VisionEval](https://visioneval.org)â€™s open-source tools are developed using a common framework that provides flexibility for adding new model features, and the software is generalized to allow for application across different regions. The VisionEval team demonstrates technical achievement in several ways: VisionEval enables users to rapidly create their own strategic models to evaluate transportation and land use policies without long setup and runtimes, and the VisionEval team embraces open-source philosophies in its development and documentation, encouraging collaboration and transparency among users and stakeholders.

The 2021 Exceptional Technical Achievement Award Committee was:

- Josie Kressner, Transport Foundry
