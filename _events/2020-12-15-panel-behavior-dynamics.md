In a rapidly evolving transportation landscape, characterized by emerging mobility options, generational shifts, and transformative transportation technologies, it is imperative that models account for behavioral dynamics for travel demand forecasting. The pace of change in lifestyles and mobility choices has accelerated dramatically in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tune in and be part of the conversation on modeling the future of mobility…accelerated.
