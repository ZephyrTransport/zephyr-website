The [GMNS](https://zephyrtransport.org/projects/2-network-standard-and-tools/) and [Network Wrangler](https://wsp-sag.github.io/network_wrangler/) teams are having a meet-up at TRB and would love for you to join us. Network Wrangler has emerged as a compelling use case for GMNS and it may be that coordinating these two efforts moving forward will maximize community benefit.
