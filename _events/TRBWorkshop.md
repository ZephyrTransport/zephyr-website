# Projects

The following is a list of the projects that we will discuss at the workshop.  These are a selection and combination of the many submittals that we received and only represent possible projects.  The Zephyr Board will be in charge of selecting projects that the organization will pursue.

## Making transportation data useful through improved data standards and management.

Effective travel analysis, planning, and policy-making requires credible and useful data that can be efficiently exchanged, analyzed, and validated.  The status quo does not support standardized measures of data validity, data management and maintenance, data schema, or dissemination.  The inconsistency of data across geographies, jurisdictions, and companies creates significant costs to researchers, analysts and data consumers that could be remedied with market-supported data standards and guidelines.  This group will explore why and how Zephyr and professional organizations can develop data standards and guidelines.

**Suggested Specific Questions / Structure**
 * Inventory of things that we should be providing data standards around
 * What will constitute a data standard?
 * Quality standard [ can be a scale ]
 * Collection methodology
 * Maintenance frequency and activities
 * Data topology and terminology
 * File format

## General Travel Network Specification

Much like Google standardized the data format for current (and archived) transit networks, the travel modeling community needs a standardized way of coding, using, and sharing travel network scenarios -- past, current and future. Generalized network specifications would reduce staff training time, scenario development time, and consultant costs. This group will roadmap what a Zephyr-supported data standard development process would look like using a general travel network specification as a specific example.

**Suggested Specific Questions / Structure**

 * What are the steps to take to create a generalized standard?
 * Who should be involved ?
 * Inventory of what already exists and some pros/cons.


## Before & After Studies

Via a grant program, Zephyr could fund and support before-and-after data collection efforts. These efforts would best occur before construction/implementation of a significant transportation policy and project, and then again after regular operations began (similar to how FTA's New Starts program works). The focus of this effort will be on understanding the changes in travel behavior that should allow for the development and validation of more robust prediction tools.

**Questions to Tackle**

 * What are different stakeholders and their needs and motivations? 
 * What goals/specific outcomes should this initiative have?
  * Offer guidance?
  * Fund Specific studies?
  * Advocate for grant programs?
  * Document/categorize solutions?
  * Specific work?
 * What budget/funding would be needed?
 * What priority/urgency should before and after studies have compared to others for Zephyr?
 
## Forecasting Uncertain Topics

Current travel demand models are observed conditions models. For the first time in decades, the industry is faced with transformational changes within the span of our forecasts that renders those conditions obsolete. This proposal is to create a parallel version of a model which considers “uncertain topics” such as the introduction of automated and connected vehicles. The model would exist as a set of alternate procedures that could be toggled on and off, and would inform certain changes to the structure of the observed conditions model necessary to invoke these changes. What would such a model need to consider? Changes to highway operations such as capacities, speeds, volume/delay functions, signal operations; changes to how travel costs are experienced or perceived; Changes in how passenger vehicles are allocated and used; and more. How could Zephyr help spearhead this work?

**Questions to Tackle**

 * What are different stakeholders and their needs and motivations?   
   * Decision-makers need both answers they can use and full understanding of spectrum of likelihoods  
   * Spectrums are hard to understand and hard to create  
 * What can Zephyr do to help? What goals/specific outcomes should this initiative have? 
   * Offer guidance?  
   * Document/categorize solutions?  
   * Undertake specific work or research?  
 * What steps are involved in moving this initiative forward? What are their cost and the needed timing?
 * What priority/urgency should this initiative have compared to others for Zephyr?  


## Model Vs. Model

Zephyr could consider providing research grants to academics and other researchers to calibrate their model systems for a single metropolitan area. Then, assess the models' performance across time, ideally a period of ten years, to see how well they perform.  This project would explore what it would take to do this in a rigorous and useful way; how to select the test bed and identify the set of stakeholders; and determine what resources would be needed to make it successful. 

**Questions to Tackle** 

 * What are different stakeholders and their needs and motivations? 
 * What goals/specific outcomes should this initiative have?
  * What steps are involved in moving this initiative forward, i.e.:
  * Test bed where?
  * Data and terminology standards
  * Definition of “better”
 * What budget/funding would be needed?
 * What priority/urgency should model vs model have compared to others for Zephyr?
 
 
## Count Dracula’s Lab: Standardizing observed travel data

Travel analysis will increasingly be relying on massive amounts of data collected using imperfect and inconsistent methods. Agencies and consultants that have the bandwidth for utilizing these data sources undertake a significant amount of start-up time in wrangling the data, while others rely on either data providers, who typically do not divulge their methods, or consultants, who often are doing the same thing over and over again, reducing efficiency. Some agencies like SFCTA have developed nascent open source tools to store and wrangle data and interface with travel models, such as “CountDracula.” However, public agencies are not good owners of open source products.  This project would: 
	(A) create standardized data schema for observed travel data; 
	(B) build upon the CountDracula data management tool; 
	(C) extend CountDracula to add a "Count Dracula's Lab" which would add data fusion and cleaning features; and 
	(D) extend CountDracula's visualization features to be more public facing.

**Questions to Tackle** 

 * What are different users and their needs? 
 * What features are most useful to each user [ create user stories ] 
 * Who are the stakeholders that would want this to happen? 
 * Who should be working on this project / involved / managing it? 
 * What does the potential product evolution look like? MVP, v1, v2, etc. 
 * What are the data standards that we would need? 
 * What methods exist that could be implemented vs need to be developed/researched? 

## Community-Owned Travel Analysis Software

The travel analysis community has developed and contributed to a multitude of open-source software projects.  These projects have been motivated for a multitude of reasons and are often either complementary to commercial analysis products or fulfill a need that is not yet commercially viable.
 
The following list is a sample of the types of open-source travel analysis software under active development:
1. Travel Modeling Frameworks in use by Agencies: ActivitySim, DaySim, CT-RAMP, MATSIM, etc.
2. Dynamic network assignment: Dynus-T, DTALite, and Fast-Trips
1. Sketch Planning Packages: the VisionEval Family
1. Transit Assignment: Fast-Trips
1. Land Use Models: UrbanSim
1. Supporting packages and tools: Benefit Cost tools, ORCA, Pandanas, Wrangler, CountDracula, dtaAnyway, helper scripts, population synthesizers

These projects are wide ranging in scope, management, standards, and ownership.  A common theme is that if well managed and designed, they could be broadly applicable to a number of public needs obviating unnecessary duplication.  Unfortunately many of these projects lack a permanent and actively managed home due to projects and funding ending or public agencies being [ necessarily ] focused on their specific needs rather than designing and maintaining for a broader audience.  Would Zephyr be a good home for projects such as these and provide (with assistance from others) the necessary administrative, financial, and technical resources?  Should Zephyr also create a directory of open-source projects and code such that one could find what already exists?


**Suggested Specific Questions / Structure**

 * What are different stakeholders and their needs? What are their motivations and concerns?
 * What types of projects should be candidates for incubation? 
 * Using ActivitySim as an example (assuming it meets these qualifications)
 * What would process look like for signing over management?
  * What role would original management team have?
  * What concerns need to be alleviated/addressed?
 * Is there a stage-gating approach to adoption/endorsement?  I.e. Library-->Incubation-->Full project-->endorsement
 * What would a useful project directory look like? What projects should be in the library of consideration?
 * What priority/urgency should software development have compared to others for Zephyr?


## Reproducible Research

Scientific journals have long been central to ensuring the validity and credibility of science through: data recording and sharing, reproducibility and external review.  However, as our data sets become larger, and our models more complex, the limits of the scientific paper as the basic unit of trade are increasingly clear. Put simply: a complex model is difficult to describe in 10,000 words.  Even in cases where a model is well-formulated and clearly expressed mathematically in an available peer-reviewed paper, it can still be a major challenge to reproduce and build upon existing research. It may be that the software or data are sitting on a lone researcher’s computer, or the code may be impenetrable to anyone other than the original author. Or it may be that the model is carefully crafted to work in one specific instance, so applying the model to a different city is challenging. 

Two potential projects to consider for addressing this issue are peer reviews and a special journal issue: 

_Peer Reviews_: This project would arrange for a system of peer reviews of research or models. It would operate in addition to the journal publication process. Rather than focusing on intellectual merit, would focus on reproducibility.  Can the reviewer run the actual model (as opposed to just reading the paper)?  Is the software clear and well-documented?  How hard is it to add one more variable?  Are all data available?  A positive review would result in a "badge" on the paper, on the project's website, or on the author's CV.  

_Special Journal Issue_: Zephyr could sponsor a special issue of a  leading journal dedicated to reproducing existing research for a new location or environment. A different set of authors would start from an existing paper, and attempt to reproduce the results for their own data.  Authors would highlight the “pain points” in trying to replicate existing work, as well as determine whether the conclusions still hold.  Authors would be required to share their own data and code in a way that allows others to reproduce their work more easily in the future. 

This workshop will discuss what a reproducible research initiative might look like within Zephyr and develop it into a practical roadmap that could be implemented.  

Suggested Specific Questions / Structure
 * Why is reproducible research important? What are different stakeholders and their needs? 
 * What are the reasons why research isn’t reproducible?
 * What activities should Zephyr undertake and who needs to be involved?
  * Peer Reviews
  * Special Journal 
  * Other?
 * What research is most important to be reproducible / where should we focus our efforts?
 * What priority/urgency should this initiative have compared to others for Zephyr?

## Before & After Studies

Before and after studies are useful to to analysis and model developers as well as planners and policy-makers.  Analysts and model developers can use these studies to learn from mistakes and provide data to calibrate their tools.  Planners and policy-makers can use them to bookend probably outcomes, learn from mistakes, and point to other successes as examples.  However, most existing efforts to systematically document before and after states  have focused on a specific type of forecast (major transit projects or toll roads) or as specific agency, which makes it difficult to draw comparisons between types of models and methods. 

Zephyr could support before-and-after data collection efforts and analysis that would best occur before construction/implementation of a significant transportation policy and project, and then again after regular operations began (similar to how FTA's New Starts program works).  Zephyr could also support, maintain, and manage the data storage perpetually rather than on a project-by-project basis.

**Suggested Specific Questions / Structure**

 * What are different stakeholders and their needs and motivations? 
 * What can Zephyr do to help? What goals/specific outcomes should this initiative have?
  * Offer guidance?
  * Fund Specific studies?
  * Host a database?
  * Undertake the work of data collection for priority projects?
  * Advocate for grant programs?
  * Document/categorize solutions?
  * Specific work?
 * What priority/urgency should this initiative have compared to others for Zephyr?
