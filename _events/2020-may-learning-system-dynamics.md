summary:  "Whether they call it that or not, MPOs do a lot of planning under deep uncertainty. Modelers need a quick way to look at very different scenarios. In this webinar, we’ll talk about the larger context of planning under uncertainty, and more specifically about how system dynamics concepts can allow for a better appreciation of the dynamic nature of features of the transportation system. After a simple exercise exploring these concepts by looking at road safety statistics during pandemic-induced decreases in VMT, we’ll wrap up with an open discussion about how participants might use these ideas in their work, whether with emerging modes, uncertainty in demand, or other planning challenges.  <p>This session will be moderated by Hannah Rakoff, Scott Smith and Jingsi Shaw of the U.S. DOT Volpe National Transportation Systems Center, with panelist Jeremy Raw of FHWA’s Office of Planning.
