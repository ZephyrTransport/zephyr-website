### Project Shark Tank

Billy Charlton hosted a Shark Tank where we had three people pitch projects or initiatives that they thought Zephyr should take on. A panel of board members and founding stakeholders [ Clint Daniels, Mario Scott, and Julie Dunbar ] convened to select a winner.

Congratulations to Lisa Zorn for pitching the winning topic and to Joe Castiglione and Kermit Wies who put forward important topics for Zephyr to consider.

## Saving the Best for Last

As part of the "Saving the Best for Last" plenary session, small groups discussed and wrote down feedback about the conference as well as suggestions for what they thought Zephyr should take on, summarized as:

- Succeed; focus on a few things and do them well
- Get Started, stop talking, pick projects
- Tell more people who they are
- Unite modelers; be a bigger voice than individual agencies and firms; include a variety of voices
- Develop standards and best practices
- Facilitate use of common data standards [ especially network standards ]
- Encourage participation in projects from multiple institutions/agencies/firms
- Develop practical tools and training; make mundane tasks go away, especially for smaller agencies
