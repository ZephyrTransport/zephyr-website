<p>
During this Learning Session, panelists will discuss the following topics for the first half of the session, followed by 30 minutes for discussion.
<ul>
<li>What Big Data set(s) have panelists worked with and what questions were they trying to answer with the dataset?</li>
<li>How did panelists <strong>verify</strong> that the data was accurate enough for its intended purpose?  How did they resolve or compensate for any issues?</li>
<li>How did panelists <strong>verify</strong> that under represented groups were represented in the data accurately?</li>
<li>How did panelists handle Big Data changes/volatility?  (e.g., legislative impacts, mobile phone operating system privacy updates, etc.)</li>
</ul>
