summary: "<i>Meeting Takeaways</i><hr>Recapped other efforts in same realm and how they are similar/diffrent to Fast-Trips.<br>The group discussed the draft scope for a fellowship (Attachment A) and came to the conclusion that there are three types of work to be done that should likely be undertaken with people that have specialized skill sets in each: software engineering, algorithm research, and usability tuning.<br><ul><li>Task 1, creating a better algorithm testing environment, should be completed by a software developer.  Leah Silen and potentially the eScience institute may be able to assist.<li>Task 2, algorithm development, is best suited for a graduate student or applied researchers.  This task is probably also easier to find outside funds to apply for so we should start looking for potential grants.<li>Tasks 3-5 are focused on creating a usable product for agencies.  Peter Bosa from Portland Metro mentioned that they may be able to provide in-kind support and before/after data for Tasks 3-5.</ul>The group was generally in agreement that they should use the existing Fast-Trips funds to pursue Task 1 and seek out grant funds for Task 2.<br><br><i>Full meeting minutes will be posted to project page upon review by the PMG.</i>"
