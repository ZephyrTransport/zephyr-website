*Congratulations to the winner of the 2021 Zephyr Leadership Award: Bill Davidson.*

To be a leader in our profession almost by definition means advancing our practice technically, and Bill has a long history of contributions, especially in the realm of transit demand forecasting.  Bill's efforts have included involvement in countless real-world applications where he has been a strong advocate for transparency and technical rigor in both data analysis and decision making, as well as the value and practical necessity of “telling the story”.   At the same time, Bill's efforts have also been integral to advancing national-level consistency in travel demand forecasting practice, specifically in context of New Starts forecasting.  

But perhaps the most important and fundamental way in which Bill has led our field is through his mentorship of other leaders, both Bill's peers as well as the next generation of travel demand forecasting professionals.  Bill has demonstrated a singular ability to recognize others’ strengths and talents, across a broad range of domains including econometrics, programming, model applications or project management, and to help them advance individually while also advancing our profession. This leadership award is given to Bill not only in recognition of his individual contributions and accomplishments but also to acknowledge that his mentorship has directly led to countless other contributions and accomplishments by those whom he has guided, supported, and advocated for throughout his career.  Thank you, Bill, for strengthening our practice as well as our people.
