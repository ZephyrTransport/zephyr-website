**Congratulations to the winner of the 2023 Impactful Research Award: Dr. Greg Erhardt**

With the Leadership award, Zephyr recognizes an individual who adds to and improves our community and the world-at-large.  Such a leader recognizes how things can be done better, answers critical questions of interest and to advance practice through key insights, and upholds values of accountability, transparency, honesty, and integrity. 

The individual selected by the Zephyr Leadership award committee this year who exemplifies these values is Dr. Greg Erhardt. Greg has a taken practical orientation towards answering some of the most important challenges and questions in transportation planning, policy-making and investment, including:
- Causes and trends in transit ridership changes prior to the COVID pandemic
- Effects of TNCs on congestion and transit ridership in San Francisco
- Developing new methods for exploring how new shuttles or demand-responsive transit may help address transit challenges
- The accuracy of traffic forecasting as a practice
- How diverse and complex datasets can be leveraged to address new questions

Gregâ€™s work has led directly to the shaping of public policy in San Francisco, including the implementation of a fee on TNC trips to help finance transit and non-motorized investments that seek to mitigate the congestion impacts of TNCs.
