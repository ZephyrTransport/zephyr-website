**Congratulations to the winner of the 2023 Impactful Research Award: Dr. Greg Erhardt**

[Dr. Erhardt](https://www.engr.uky.edu/directory/erhardt-greg) has a practical orientation towards developing solutions and answering some of the most important challenges and questions in transportation planning, policy-making and investment.  This ranges from seeking to answer basic questions about how TNCs may affect traffic congestion and transit ridership, to developing new data fusion methods that may be increasingly important if a “mobility on demand” future emerges.  He has led countless cutting-edge travel forecasting model development efforts, most recently in the context of the T-SCORE project, but has also led rigorous and critical assessment of the accuracy of forecasting as currently practiced.  He is an effective and reliable mentor and colleague.
