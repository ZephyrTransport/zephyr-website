Dr. Handy's contributions have profoundly advanced the theoretical and practical landscapes of our field. Her journey began with an education and professional experience grounded in civil engineering, where she first encountered the limitations of engineering-centric approaches to transportation challenges. This realization propelled her towards a doctorate in planning, aiming to address these issues with a broader, more integrated perspective. Her unique ability to navigate and bridge both the academic and practical realms as well as those of engineering and planning  has fostered significant advancements and collaboration across these sectors.

A testament to her impact is her challenge to the traditional "predict and provide" methodology of long-range transportation planning, which she argued was neither effective nor sustainableâ€”economically, socially, or environmentally. Rather than merely critiquing the status quo, Dr. Handy's diverse experience fueled her empathy and collaborative spirit, enabling her to work alongside current professionals towards better solutions. Her research on induced demand not only provided empirical evidence but also supported the development and implementation of policies that acknowledge and address this phenomenon. Furthermore, Dr. Handy has been instrumental in creating and disseminating accessible, low-cost tools for communities, bridging the gap between sophisticated state resources and local needs.

Dr. Handy's unwavering commitment to mentoring epitomizes her dedication to the future of transportation planning. Her ability to inspire a sense of purpose and innovation has influenced many in their careers, extending her legacy. Through her book "Shifting Gears" and beyond, Dr. Handy continues to shape the industry, reaching an audience far wider than her immediate circle.

As we honor her with the Zephyr Foundation Leadership Award, we not only celebrate her individual achievements but also her enduring impact on fostering an empathetic, curious, and pragmatic travel analysis community, propelling us toward a more thoughtful and inclusive future.
