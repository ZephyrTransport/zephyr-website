### Zephyr has a free Slack discussion channel.

Slack is an online discussion platform with multiple channels, direct messages, and more.

We're hoping our use of Slack keeps the "barrier to entry" for Zephyr as low as possible. Plus, it's a great way to ask questions or just engage with other Zephyr members who share our goals of improving transportation research!
