Zephyr is having a special election to fill vacancies on its <a href="/leadership/#board">Board</a>. The Board is charged with determining the projects and direction for Zephyr, the composition of project management groups, and maintaining the core organization.  We seeking [nominations](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyOYcFQt-OeKC8CL7s9J7GC4IOuupP97kWmJPhLKODmDEiyw/viewform) to fill three open seats.

Zephyr is an all-volunteer organization and it depends on membership for literally everything it does. This year the Board will be focusing on:
* Incorporating feedback gathered from Zephyr stakeholders into a new 5-year plan for the organization;
* Streamlining admin operations; and
* Enabling new projects, activities, and initiatives.

## Become a member to vote

One of the most important aspects of being a member of the Zephyr Foundation
is having a vote in the annual Zephyr Board election. Our board is elected every June according to our bylaws.

To be eligible to vote you must be a member in good standing as of **November 2021** You can become a member or renew your membership at <a href="/membership/">zephyrtransport.org/membership</a>.

## Nominations for Board members open on May 5

Anyone can submit nominations for the Zephyr Board; nominations for 2022 board members are
due by May 30th, 2022 at midnight PDT. Nominees will be asked if they accept the nomination
and then will be given an opportunity to prepare statements in support
of their nomination before the election.

Have you ever thought about becoming more involved in a professional organization or are you curious how a
non-profit board works? Are you dedicated to improving the field of travel analysis and want to make a lasting
positive impression? Please consider [nominating yourself](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyOYcFQt-OeKC8CL7s9J7GC4IOuupP97kWmJPhLKODmDEiyw/viewform)

if it is something that would be a good fit for you. 

Zephyr prides itself in supporting diverse opinions and backgrounds on its board and in its membership. We welcome all nominations.

## 2022 Election Process

### I. Open Seats

Open seats are determined by the sum of:

A. Board members with expired terms;
B. Board members who have expressed a desire to rotate off the board early;
C. Any increase in the number of board seats.

The Secretary will confirm the number of board members with expired terms and any increase in board seats based on organizational records. The chair will confirm the desires of individual board members to serve for the following year and relay any additional seat information to the Secretary.

### II. Nominations

The Secretary will compile a list of board seat nominations from the Board as well as from an [open nominations form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfyOYcFQt-OeKC8CL7s9J7GC4IOuupP97kWmJPhLKODmDEiyw/viewform) distributed to members no later than ten days before the election. The Secretary shall confirm with each nominated party that they would like to appear on the ballot.

### III. Eligible Members

Eligible members per the Bylaws are determined the evening prior to the announcement of the Annual Member Meeting/Election. The Secretary will be responsible for compiling a list of eligible members and giving them access to voting.

### IV. Meeting Scheduling and Announcement

The President is responsible for scheduling the annual member meeting/election. The Secretary is responsible for sending out an announcement of the meeting and the election to the membership. The election announcement can be combined with a call for nominations.

### V. Ballot

The Secretary is responsible for finalizing the ballot, which should appear in the online election as well as distributed via email. Each candidate may write a short paragraph about themself (maximum 200 words) to aid the voting members in understanding their perspective and background. The Secretary reserves the right to edit these for clarity or request revisions.

### VI. Election

There are two main avenues for casting votes in the election:

A. Online poll
B. Member Meeting

The online poll will commence no later than two days prior to the member meeting and cease 24 hours after the member meeting closes. Votes cast via the online poll are in lieu of any votes cast at the member meeting and are anonymous.

Members also have the opportunity to publicly cast their votes at the member meeting, but must declare their voter-ID in the online poll so as to preclude any double-counting. Declaring a fraudulent voter-ID is grounds for membership termination.

### Member Meeting / Election

The main purpose of the member meeting/election is to discuss board elections.

### Results Certification

The Secretary will certify the results no later than 72 hours following the poll closure and will be responsible for announcing the results to the membership and posting to the website.
