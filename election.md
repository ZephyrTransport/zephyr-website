### IV. Meeting Scheduling and Announcement  

The President is responsible for scheduling the annual member meeting.  The Secretary is responsible for sending out an announcement of the meeting and the election to the membership.  The election announcement can be combined with a call for nominations.

### V. Ballot

The Secretary is responsible for finalizing the ballot, which should appear in the online election as well as distributed via email.  Each candidate may write a short paragraph about themself (maximum 200 words) to aid the voting members in understanding their perspective and background.  The Secretary reserves the right to edit these for clarity or request revisions.

### VI. Election  

There are two main avenues for casting votes in the election:  

 A. Online poll  
 B. Member Meeting  

The online poll will commence no later than two days prior to the member meeting and cease 24 hours after the member meeting closes.  Votes cast via the online poll are in lieu of any votes cast at the member meeting and are anonymous.

Members also have the opportunity to publicly cast their votes at the member meeting, but must declare their voter-ID in the online poll so as to preclude any double-counting.  Declaring a fraudulent voter-ID is grounds for membership termination.

### Member Meeting  

The main purpose of the member meeting is to discuss board elections.  

The agenda will be:
 * Welcome and discussion of meeting purpose (President)  
 * Review of nominations (Secretary)  
 * Opportunity for candidate statements (<5 min each)  
 * Discussion of candidates (2 min per person)  
 * Opportunity to publicly cast votes (5 min)  
 * Review of remainder of process (Secretary)  
 * Reminder of next events (President)  

### Results Certification 

The Secretary will certify the results no later than 72 hours following the poll closure and will be responsible for announcing the results to the membership and posting to the website.
