## TMIP: The Travel Model Improvement Program

The Travel Model Improvement Program (TMIP) Community of Practice was created to advance the state of the practice of travel modeling by advancing research and building the technical capabilities of an array of stakeholders, including regional planning agencies, state department of transportation (DOT), universities, nonprofits and private sectors.  TMIP is built upon the fundamental principle that sharing information benefits everyone in the modeling community.

Zephyr is supporting TMIP by moderating a community-wide mailing list and archive, and by maintaining a library of two decades of webinars and other resources.
