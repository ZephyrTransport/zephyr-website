  statement: 'I am deeply honored to be one of the nominees for the Zephyr Board of Directors, and I am thrilled by the possibility of the Zephyr Foundation drawing on my research activities and background. I am an Assistant Professor of Transportation at Mississippi State University. I earned a Ph.D. in Transportation Systems Engineering along with a Master of Urban and Regional Planning from the University of Minnesota. My work on research and curriculum development has focused on identifying novel solutions, developing advanced methods, and introducing innovative theories to understand travel behavior and human aspects of mobility more realistically. If elected to the Board of Directors, I will advocate for enhancing the awareness and impact of the Zephyr Foundation through the Foundation’s goals: (1) support, (2) education, (3) guidance, (4) encouragement, and (5) incubation. I am committed to a respectful and open dialogue to include the diverse perspectives of the stakeholders we serve. I will work tirelessly with my Zephyr colleagues to continue establishing our voice for the betterment of society and quality of life through impactful and compassionate travel analysis. I will also work to expand our outreach in terms of contribution and solidarity. I will join you as a Director who is eager to better understand the needs of our members, to diversify opinions and backgrounds, to engage in the examination of current initiatives, to pursue new initiatives, and to continue efforts to assure the well-being of the foundation'

  statement: 'I’m interested in joining the Zephyr Transport Board because I believe in the organization’s mission to help improve the practice of transport analysis. My interest in bettering our practice draws from my experience as a modeler at the Oregon Department of Transportation, a software developer at PTV, a model developer at Parsons Brinckerhoff, and now as Director of Transport Software at RSG. Throughout my 17 years in the industry, I’ve developed a keen interest in collaborative initiatives such as open source software, open data standards, and open science methods. I’ve served on the TRB Urban Data and Network Modeling committees, co-created the open matrix standard for sharing data, and helped modernize Dr. Bar-Gera’s Transportation Networks for Research repository. As a consultant, I’ve played key roles in fostering two open tool development projects – the ActivitySim open platform for activity-based modeling sponsored by a consortium of transportation planning organizations and the VisionEval strategic planning framework sponsored by an FHWA-led pooled fund. My commitment to Zephyr’s work is evidenced by my involvement in the software badging committee and the Generalized Network Model Specification committee. I would love the opportunity to help shape Zephyr’s activities, to cooperate with our organizational members and leaders, and to work diligently to realize the goals we set for ourselves. Thank you for considering me for the board!'

  statement: "I lead the travel modeling and research team at the Metropolitan Council in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. I've been at the Council for twelve years and in the travel forecasting industry for twenty in both private- and public- sector roles. I'm proud that the Council has been among the first half-dozen organizational members. I've been helping for years to bring innovative planning methods to my agency with some successes and know from the front lines the need for incubation and guidance that are among Zephyr's core goals. I've been watching Zephyr's emergence with great interest and excitement over the past three years and look forward to helping guide project and overall growth. Whether I am on the board or not, I will be working on project management groups, working to grow membership, and working to promote the use of resources that emerge from existing efforts."

  statement: 'I am excited about the opportunity to serve Zephyr as a Board Member. I have an extensive back ground in the application of travel models for public sector clients (MPOs, Public Transit Agencies and State DOTs) and believe the need to provide better, more affordable tools and training to assist agency staff in responding to decision maker inquiries is of great importance. The development of recruitment programs to encourage a diverse work force of technically skilled analysts that are also good communicators is also important to me. I have a long history of volunteer work with the Transportation Research Board community, as a committee member, committee chair and conference coordinator. This volunteer experience, combined with my decades of work experience in the application of travel models for public sector clients provide the basis for my interest in serving as a member of the Zephyr Board.'

  statement: 'For thirteen years I have worked for an organization whose mission is to Make a Great Place. It’s an ethos forged in the idea that through thoughtful, deliberate, and well-informed planning policy, we can work together to create a prosperous community that is equitable, sustainable, and all-inclusive for current and future generations. My contribution to this mission has been the development and application of nationally-recognized transportation analysis tools and methods to provide decision makers the best possible data. In an effort to improve our own tools, I have partnered on federal research utilizing state-of-the-art traffic and transit assignment methods. I was most recently the Technical Program Chair of the 2019 TRB Transportation Planning Applications Conference, and know the satisfaction of working with a team of dedicated individuals in an effort to educate and advance the state of the profession with the hope of improving decision-making in our communities. The Zephyr Foundation shares this commitment to support decision-making, and seeks influence beyond a single region or planning organization. It would be a privilege to serve on behalf of this ideal and to expand my contribution from Making a Great Place to Making a Great Profession. I bring dedication, team-work, and a desire to collaborate with others to this position, and appreciate your consideration.'
