    If you're a data expert and energetic people- and service-oriented manager with a commitment to public service this job may be what you are looking for. Metro's on the cutting edge of using data and analytics to inform decisions about the future of greater Portland. The data science client services manager leads a talented team of data and map specialists who are passionate about turning complex spatial and image-based data into useful information by analyzing demographics, making maps, creating data-driven software applications in Metro's "do-it-yourself" platforms (ESRI's AGOL and Portal), and more.
    Metro is dedicated to a better future for greater Portland. With a portfolio that spans land and transportation, garbage and recycling, arts and events venues, parks and nature and the Oregon Zoo, Metro's work generates economic and cultural opportunity, protects nature and wildlife, and helps create a great place people want to call home.
    As the leader of the client services team you would bring Metro's mission to life in tangible ways that serve Metro's business lines and community, business and government partners. Recent projects include everything from processing aerial imagery to locating Oregon White Oak trees for native species preservation, mapping and quantifying the location and amount of food scraps generated in the metro area, and understanding how urban lands have developed over time to providing maps for the Metro's Parks Master Plan and creating a dashboard that displays the racial makeup of Metro's staff across its various departments.
    You would also be part of a Metro department with a reputation for driving innovation. Building on years at the forefront of land-based information systems, today client services staff are leading the effort to advance equity with qualitative and quantitative data and collaborating with a cross-department team to add machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to Metro's toolkit.
    The client services manager plays three key roles
     - Marketing the Research Center and managing client relationships in and outside of Metro
     - Leading people and supporting staff development
     - Managing business development and projects
