Zephyr is in the process of applying for 501c3 status, which would make your individual membership or contributions tax-deductible on your individual income tax returns. Until we receive notification of our status from the IRS, we cannot guarantee that any membership or contribution is eligible for a deduction on your individual income tax returns.  However, should Zephyr receive its 501c3 status at any time in 2018 (which we anticipate), any membership or donation made at any time during 2018 would be eligible.asdf
