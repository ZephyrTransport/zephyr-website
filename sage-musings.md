Sage Musing is a monthly (or so) blog series of collections of "musings" written by some of the travel analysis industry's sages. We hope that their wisdom, or at least the issues they raise, will be useful to other academics and practitioners alike. 

Musings are longer than a tweet, but short enough to read while that software update runs.

Not all the topics will be technical in nature; in fact, many of them are not. 

## Topic Submissions

If you have a topic you would love the sages to address, feel free [submit an idea](https://goo.gl/forms/O44mG8obZIu1yPq03).

Topics are distributed to the sages monthly for them to use as inspiration.
