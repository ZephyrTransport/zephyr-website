**Congratulations to the winner of the 2023 Impactful Research Award: [STOPS - Simplified Trips-on-Project Software](https://www.transit.dot.gov/funding/grant-programs/capital-investments/stops)**

STOPS' innovation is its use of census and transit time table data rather than complex regional transportation demand models. This simplification minimizes calibration time and significantly reduces project evaluation time. STOPS’ impact is evident from its adoption by nearly 100 agencies, with most major transit operators having adopted STOPS as their forecasting platform and many regions developing a regional STOPS model, including the ARC, MetCouncil, Miami-Dade, and Research Triangle region. 

STOPS demonstrates that there is value in a data-driven approach to travel demand forecasting. It highlights the importance of good data, which is not only important for transit forecasting, but also for highway forecasting. Not only has STOPS streamlined the process, allowing agencies to vet their projects or get approvals more quickly but, in many ways, it has also opened up this market to a wider range of analysts and agencies. Analytical tools that lead to good decision making while at the same time minimizing the cost of data collection and resources needed for development and analysis is a noteworthy contribution. 

Congratulations to the 2023 Recipient of the Impactful Research Award: STOPS – FTA’s Simplified Trips-On-Project Software, for changing the way we conduct modeling and analysis for major transit projects and demonstrating the value of a data-driven approach to travel demand forecasting.
